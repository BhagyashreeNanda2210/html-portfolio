<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a developer and i love coding.</p>

<p>Currently I am working on small projects but very soon i will doing more projects in different language.</p>

<p>It is good habit to practice coding daily. While making a habit of practicing it will help us in developing the concepts and our knowledge in the big world od programming. Rather than putting a big step I prefer to walk small steps so that I will successfully reach in my distination.</p>
